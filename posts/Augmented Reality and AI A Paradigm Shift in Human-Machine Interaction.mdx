## The Genesis of AR and AI:  A Brief History

The seeds of  AR  can be traced back to the early  20th century with the invention of stereoscopes, devices that provided a  three-dimensional illusion of images. Modern AR, however emerged in the 1960s, pioneered by researchers such as Ivan  Sutherland who  developed the first head-mounted display (HMD)  system.

AI, on  the other hand traces its  roots to the 1950s when notable figures like Alan Turing, the father of computer science, laid the foundation for  the field. Since then, AI has made  astonishing progress, fueled by advancements in algorithms, data  availability, and computing power.
